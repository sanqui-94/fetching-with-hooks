# fetching-with-hooks

I'm following the article wrote by [Robin Wieruch](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data/).

## Fetching details
This project will consume the [Hacker News API](https://hn.algolia.com/api).
To fetch information from the API [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library will be used.
